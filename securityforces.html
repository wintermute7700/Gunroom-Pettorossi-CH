          <div class="col-md-7 texto2">The highest technology in your hands, that is the clearest and briefest definition of the new BP, a pistol with a high resistance polymer grip, self-supporting chassis that simplifies cleaning and maintenance, polygonal barrel, loaded chamber indicator on the slide . These are just some of the characteristics that place the new BP at the top of the most modern pistols in the world, now designed and developed with the most advanced technology.
            Reliability is a fundamental factor in the performance of a weapon, and we have put our focus on it, the design of the BERSA BP has been subjected to the most demanding tests of resistance and reliability, surpassing all the existing standards until today.
            Maximum control during the shot thanks to an unmatched design, you will have the feeling of firing a larger weapon or a smaller caliber, as we have considered the ergonomics and energy factors that we who manufacture weapons for more than 50 years have known.
            Safety is another key factor in this new BERSA product, that is why the BP has fall, magazine and trigger locks and a visible and tactile loaded chamber indicator on the slide.
            The capacity is superlative for a compact monofilament gun, 8 + 1 in a gun of this size provides even more reasons to choose the new BP.
            Add up all the characteristics described, feel control, in your hands, compare us, try us, feel the difference, you know, you can trust.
            Each one of the BERSA pistols of the BP line is a weapon designed for intensive use, of the highest quality, built with materials of international standard, optimal in their application for firearms. The components of these weapons have been manufactured with the latest technology, guaranteeing their quality and interchangeability of components.
            The locking system is by short recoil, tilting barrel and fitting in the ejection window, which ensures a positive and firm link between the barrel tube and the slide at the moment of firing, and a decoupling that favors the expulsion of the pods. served and loading a new cartridge without interruption.
            The pistol has three highly effective locks that work automatically. The first one keeps the firing pin locked, and the second one keeps the trigger locked; in both cases this occurs while the trigger tail is not activated, thus preventing the possibility of an involuntary shot due to falls, shocks or vibrations. The third is the magazine insurance, which makes percussion impossible if the magazine is not housed and retained in the weapon.
            Disassembly for cleaning of all BP series guns is extremely easy. It is carried out by removing the same component that acts as a slide retainer, dividing the weapon into a few pieces of considerable size, to avoid the loss of components.
            The weapon has a discharged weapon warning, with the slide remaining in the open position when the last cartridge in the magazine is fired.
            All BERSA weapons have a surface finish that significantly reduces the shine and discomfort that this produces, improving the performance of the shooter.
            All BERSA weapons have a treatment on the slide and barrel tube called Tenifer, which significantly increases the surface hardness thus avoiding scratches, wear and dents. This treatment also provides great resistance to corrosion, successfully passing salt spray and weathering tests.
            The weapon has a cartridge warning housed in the chamber, both visual and tactile. The chamber bullet indicator pops up when a round is in the barrel chamber, and reverts back into the slide when the slide is empty.</div>
